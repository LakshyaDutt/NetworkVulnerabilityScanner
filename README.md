# Network-Vulnerability-Scanner
Our proposed approach to enhance our network vulnerability scanning is by modelling the scanning process using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The MDP based approach would bypass the ambiguity tied to the configuration state of target system. Instead, it would embed uncertainty into the probability of successful identification of each potential vulnerability. Compared to the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process Model, the MDP model is computationally more manageable and does not demand a comprehensive understanding of the network host specifics. Nevertheless, it does require a foundational understanding of the success probabilities associated with each potential detection action. Additionally, it standardizes the treatment of each target system, rather than leveraging collected insights to craft more nuanced scans.
